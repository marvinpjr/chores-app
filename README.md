## Setup
  * If you don't have git installed locally on your machine, you'll need that. Instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
  * Clone this repository locally on your machine. From a command line use command `git clone https://github.com/marvinpjr/chores-app.git`.
  * If you don't have npm and node on your machine, you'll need to install them. See [these instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
  * From a command line, install the Vue cli (version 3.x or higher) with command `npm install -g vue-cli ` on Windows or `sudo npm install -g vue-cli` if you are on a Mac.
  * Navigate into the 'chores-web' folder with `cd web` and install dependencies with command `npm install`. This will take awhile to run.
  * (Optional) If you are using Chrome, there's a [debugging extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd) that you can install which may help troubleshoot issues. 

## Useful Commands
  * To run the app, use the command `npm run serve`. The app server will start and keep running. If you are viewing it in your browser, it will update live as you make changes.
  * To simply build the app, use the command `npm run build`.
  * To run a linter and apply fixes, use `npm run lint`.
