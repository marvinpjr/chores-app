## Setup
  * If you don't have git installed locally on your machine, you'll need that. Instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
  * Clone this repository locally on your machine. From a command line use command `git clone https://github.com/marvinpjr/chores-app.git`.
  * If you don't have npm and node on your machine, you'll need to install them. See [these instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
  * From a command line, install the Vue cli with command `npm install -g vue-cli ` on Windows or `sudo npm install -g vue-cli` if you are on a Mac.
  * Navigate into the 'chores-web' folder with `cd web` and install dependencies with command `npm install`. This will take awhile to run.
  * To run the app, use the command `npm run serve`
